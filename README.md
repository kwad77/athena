## Features

- Interactive chat interface with AI models
- Document upload and processing (PDF, DOCX)
- Multiple chat sessions management
- Model selection for different conversations
- Image pasting and display in chat (working on adding image summarization - will require vision enabled model)
- Chat export functionality
- Customizable settings

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Ollama (for local language model inference)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/athena-ai-assistant.git
   cd athena-ai-assistant
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

3. Use the interface to:
   - Start new chat sessions
   - Upload and process documents
   - Interact with AI models
   - Export chat histories

## Development
